"Even though we're able to define what money is, when it comes to its "
"origins, money has been mum about them. For such a central element of our"

"Some economists assume that bartering of goods and services inspired "
"money’s invention. On the other hand there are anthropologists and "
"archaeologists contending that early states invented currency as a means "
"of debt payment."

msgid ""
"Several investigations suggest that money independently appeared for "
"different reasons and assumed different tangible forms in many parts of "
"the world, starting thousands of years ago and bartering had nothing to "
"do with it but instead, money grew out of older systems of credit and "
"debt. In small-scale societies, debts concern obligations to others while"
" among hunter-gatherer and farming groups daughters given away in "
"marriage create debts that are partially repaid with goods known as "
"bridewealth where full repayment requires that the recipient of the first"
" bride provide a bride in return. No cash needed."

"Revisionists argue that a transition to a new form of money-friendly debt"
" started at least 5,500 years ago in the agricultural states of "
"Mesopotamia and Egypt. In Mesopotamia, the silver shekel — a lump of "
"metal, not a coin — was a basic monetary measure. Rulers decreed that one"
" shekel’s weight in silver was equivalent to a bushel of barley. Shekels "
"of silver, gold and other metals were used in other ancient societies. "
"Precise weights of shekels appear to have varied from one to the next one"
" and therefore are difficult to pin down. Farmers were taxed to support "
"royal lifestyles and public works, what the farmers and other commoners "
"couldn’t pay in goods was recorded as debt in shekels. Merchants and "
"tradespeople acquired goods from temple and palace officials on credit."

"Coins stamped with images of animals or rulers, acting as denominations "
"and guaranteeing the metal’s value, first appeared in the kingdom of "
"Lydia around 2,600 years ago. Located in what is now Turkey, Lydia sat on"
" the cusp between the Mediterranean and the Near East, and commerce with "
"foreign travelers was common which was one of the major promoters for "
"this coin mint to happen. To understand why, imagine doing a trade in the"
" absence of money or in other words through barter. The chief problem "
"with barter is the double coincidence of wants. Say you have a bunch of "
"bananas and would like a pair of shoes, but it's not enough to find "
"someone who has some shoes or someone who wants some bananas. To make the"
" trade, you need to find someone who has shoes they're willing to trade "
"and that wants bananas which is no easy task."
msgstr ""

"With a common currency, the task becomes easier: You just sell your "
"bananas to someone in exchange for money, with which you then buy shoes "
"from someone else. And if, as in Lydia, you have foreigners from whom "
"you'd like to buy or to whom you'd like to sell, having a common medium "
"of exchange is obviously valuable. That is, money is especially useful "
"when dealing with people you don't know and may never see again."

"The Lydian system's breakthrough was the standardized metal coin. Made of"
" a gold-silver alloy called electrum, one coin was exactly like "
"another—unlike, say, cattle. Also unlike cattle, the coins didn't age or "
"die or otherwise change over time. And they were much easier to carry "
"around. Other kingdoms followed Lydia's example, and coins became "
"ubiquitous throughout the Mediterranean, with kingdoms stamping their "
"insignia on the coins they minted. This had a dual effect: it facilitated"
" the flow of trade, and it established the authority of the state."

"The spread of money throughout the Mediterranean didn't mean that it was "
"universally used; soon after Lydia, cities and states in Greece, Persia, "
"India and China began to strike their own coins, but even then most "
"people were still subsistence farmers and existed largely outside the "
"money economy. But as money became more common, it encouraged the spread "
"of markets. Once a small part of the economy is taken over by markets and"
" money, they tend to colonize the rest of the economy, gradually forcing "
"out barter, feudalism, and other economic arrangements. This happens "
"mostly because money makes market transactions so much easier and also "
"because using money seems to redefine what people value, pushing them to "
"view things in economic, rather than social, terms."

"Governments were quick to embrace hard currency because it facilitated "
"the collection of taxes and the building of military forces, coins funded"
" armies and wars of conquest. In the process, coins became legal tender "
"for all sorts of transactions. Marketplaces were a result of this system,"
" not its cause, revisionists argue."

"Once the Chinese had started making comparatively inexpensive paper from "
"natural fibers, and discovered block-printing, paper currency came into "
"use in the country. The first known use of paper currency in China is "
"reported from the Tang dynasty and despite the fact that scarce "
"information remains about this early system of paper currency there's "
"evidence that these were certificates issued by the Tang government to "
"pay local merchants in distants parts of the empire. By using "
"certificates, the government could avoid having to transport metal money "
"far away. Each certificate had a certain amount of money stated on it and"
" was redeemable for metal cash on demand in the Chinese capital. Most "
"merchants never went through the trouble of going to the capital to get "
"cash for their certificate, instead the certificates were used as money "
"locally, since they were transfereable. The view of money as commodity "
"began to shift only with the widespread adoption of paper currency."

"Compared to traditional money made from precious metals, paper currency "
"was easier to transport, and the use of paper currency also freed up "
"metal that could be put to other use. In 1821, the Bank of England "
"adopted the gold standard, promising to redeem its notes for gold upon "
"request. As other countries followed suit, the gold standard became the "
"general rule for developed economies. The discovery of major new gold "
"fields over the course of the 19th century ensured that the money supply "
"kept growing."

msgid ""
"The gold standard, as it was intended to do, brought stability to prices "
"and was enormously beneficial to property holders and lenders. However, "
"it also brought deflation—that is, prices generally fell—because as "
"countries, populations and economies grew, their governments had no easy "
"way to increase the money supply short of mining more gold, and so money "
"in effect became more scarce. Deflation was hard on farmers and "
"borrowers, who longed for a little inflation to help them with their "
"debts; when money gradually loses some of its value, so, too, do people's"
" debts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../01_beginner.rst:45
msgid ""
"What finally derailed the gold standard was World War I. Since "
"governments needed more money for their militaries than they had in gold,"
" and so they simply began printing it. And though many countries tried to"
" return to the gold standard after the war, the Great Depression "
"consequences made it end for good. Because of this currencies today are "
"“fiat\" currencies, meaning they're backed by the authority of the "
"issuing government, and nothing more."
msgstr ""

#: ../../01_beginner.rst:47
msgid ""
"In the United States, for example, that means the government accepts only"
" dollars as payment for taxes and requires its creditors to accept "
"dollars in payment for debts. But if people were to lose faith in the "
"dollar and stop accepting it in everyday transactions, it would "
"eventually become worthless. The reliance on fiat money, we're told, "
"gives too much power to the government, which can recklessly print as "
"much money as it wants. Yet the truth is that this has always been "
"possible. Even with the gold standard, governments revalued their "
"currencies from time to time, in effect dictating a new price for gold, "
"or they ignored the standard when it proved too limiting, as during the "
"First World War. What's more, the notion that gold is somehow more "
"“real\" than paper is, well, a mirage. Gold is valuable because we've "
"collectively decided that it's valuable and that we'll accept goods and "
"services in exchange for it. And that's no different, ultimately, from "
"our collective decision that colorful rectangles of paper are valuable "
"and that we'll accept goods and services in exchange for them."

"While most of the time, the terms \"money\" and \"currency\" are used "

" money cannot be touched or smelled. Currency is the coin, note, or "

"The powerful combination of computers and telecommunications, of "
"smartphones and social media, of cryptography and virtual economies makes"
" it seem like it's a possibility to create a cashless society. What "
"matters most about money is not what it is, but what it does. After all, "
"people will use the currencies that lubricate commerce, allow people to "
"exchange goods and services, and thus encourage people to work and "
"create. Money, whether it's represented by a metal coin, a shell or a "
"piece of paper, doesn't always have value. Its value depends on the "
"importance that people place on it—as a store of value, a unit of "
"account, and a medium of exchange. Money is valuable merely because "
"everyone knows that it will be accepted as a form of payment. However, "
"throughout history, both the usage and the form of money have evolved."
