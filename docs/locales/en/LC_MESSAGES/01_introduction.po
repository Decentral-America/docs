msgid "Even though we're able to define what money is, when it comes to itsorigins, money has been mum about them. For such a central element of our lives, money’s ancient roots and the reasons for its invention areunclear, most of the available knowledge is based on conjectures andlogical inferences."

msgstr ""

#: ../../01_introduction.md:19
msgid "Several investigations suggest that money independently appeared fordifferent reasons and assumed different tangible forms in many parts ofthe world, starting thousands of years ago and bartering had nothing todo with it but instead, money grew out of older systems of credit anddebt. In small-scale societies, debts concern obligations to others while among hunter-gatherer and farming groups daughters given away inmarriage create debts that are partially repaid with goods known asbridewealth where full repayment requires that the recipient of the first bride provide a bride in return. No cash needed."

msgid "Revisionists argue that a transition to a new form of money-friendly debt started at least 5,500 years ago in the agricultural states ofMesopotamia and Egypt. In Mesopotamia, the silver shekel — a lump ofmetal, not a coin — was a basic monetary measure. Rulers decreed that one shekel’s weight in silver was equivalent to a bushel of barley. Shekelsof silver, gold and other metals were used in other ancient societies.Precise weights of shekels appear to have varied from one to the next one and therefore are difficult to pin down. Farmers were taxed to supportroyal lifestyles and public works, what the farmers and other commonerscouldn’t pay in goods was recorded as debt in shekels. Merchants andtradespeople acquired goods from temple and palace officials on credit."

msgid "Coins stamped with images of animals or rulers, acting as denominationsand guaranteeing the metal’s value, first appeared in the kingdom ofLydia around 2,600 years ago. Located in what is now Turkey, Lydia sat on the cusp between the Mediterranean and the Near East, and commerce withforeign travelers was common which was one of the major promoters forthis coin mint to happen. To understand why, imagine doing a trade in the absence of money or in other words through barter. The chief problemwith barter is the double coincidence of wants. Say you have a bunch ofbananas and would like a pair of shoes, but it's not enough to findsomeone who has some shoes or someone who wants some bananas. To make the trade, you need to find someone who has shoes they're willing to tradeand that wants bananas which is no easy task."
msgstr ""

#: ../../01_introduction.md:25
msgid "With a common currency, the task becomes easier: You just sell yourbananas to someone in exchange for money, with which you then buy shoesfrom someone else. And if, as in Lydia, you have foreigners from whomyou'd like to buy or to whom you'd like to sell, having a common mediumof exchange is obviously valuable. That is, money is especially usefulwhen dealing with people you don't know and may never see again."

msgid "The Lydian system's breakthrough was the standardized metal coin. Made of a gold-silver alloy called electrum, one coin was exactly likeanother—unlike, say, cattle. Also unlike cattle, the coins didn't age ordie or otherwise change over time. And they were much easier to carryaround. Other kingdoms followed Lydia's example, and coins becameubiquitous throughout the Mediterranean, with kingdoms stamping theirinsignia on the coins they minted. This had a dual effect: it facilitated the flow of trade, and it established the authority of the state."
msgstr ""

#: ../../01_introduction.md:29
msgid "The spread of money throughout the Mediterranean didn't mean that it wasuniversally used; soon after Lydia, cities and states in Greece, Persia,India and China began to strike their own coins, but even then mostpeople were still subsistence farmers and existed largely outside themoney economy. But as money became more common, it encouraged the spreadof markets. Once a small part of the economy is taken over by markets and money, they tend to colonize the rest of the economy, gradually forcingout barter, feudalism, and other economic arrangements. This happensmostly because money makes market transactions so much easier and alsobecause using money seems to redefine what people value, pushing them toview things in economic, rather than social, terms."

msgid "Governments were quick to embrace hard currency because it facilitatedthe collection of taxes and the building of military forces, coins funded armies and wars of conquest.

msgid "Once the Chinese had started making comparatively inexpensive paper fromnatural fibers, and discovered block-printing, paper currency came intouse in the country. The first known use of paper currency in China isreported from the Tang dynasty and despite the fact that scarceinformation remains about this early system of paper currency there'sevidence that these were certificates issued by the Tang government topay local merchants in distants parts of the empire. By usingcertificates, the government could avoid having to transport metal moneyfar away. Each certificate had a certain amount of money stated on it and was redeemable for metal cash on demand in the Chinese capital. Mostmerchants never went through the trouble of going to the capital to getcash for their certificate, instead the certificates were used as moneylocally, since they were transfereable. The view of money as commoditybegan to shift only with the widespread adoption of paper currency."

msgid "Compared to traditional money made from precious metals, paper currencywas easier to transport, and the use of paper currency also freed upmetal that could be put to other use. In 1821, the Bank of Englandadopted the gold standard, promising to redeem its notes for gold uponrequest. As other countries followed suit, the gold standard became thegeneral rule for developed economies. The discovery of major new goldfields over the course of the 19th century ensured that the money supplykept growing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../01_introduction.md:37
msgid "The gold standard, as it was intended to do, brought stability to pricesand was enormously beneficial to property holders and lenders. However,it also brought deflation—that is, prices generally fell—because ascountries, populations and economies grew, their governments had no easyway to increase the money supply short of mining more gold, and so moneyin effect became more scarce. Deflation was hard on farmers andborrowers, who longed for a little inflation to help them with theirdebts; when money gradually loses some of its value, so, too, do people's debts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../01_introduction.md:39
msgid "What finally derailed the gold standard was World War I. Sincegovernments needed more money for their militaries than they had in gold, and so they simply began printing it. And though many countries tried to return to the gold standard after the war, the Great Depressionconsequences made it end for good. Because of this currencies today are“fiat\" currencies, meaning they're backed by the authority of theissuing government, and nothing more."

msgid "In the United States, for example, that means the government accepts only dollars as payment for taxes and requires its creditors to acceptdollars in payment for debts. But if people were to lose faith in thedollar and stop accepting it in everyday transactions, it wouldeventually become worthless. The reliance on fiat money, we're told,gives too much power to the government, which can recklessly print asmuch money as it wants. Yet the truth is that this has always beenpossible. Even with the gold standard, governments revalued theircurrencies from time to time, in effect dictating a new price for gold,or they ignored the standard when it proved too limiting, as during theFirst World War. What's more, the notion that gold is somehow more“real\" than paper is, well, a mirage. Gold is valuable because we'vecollectively decided that it's valuable and that we'll accept goods andservices in exchange for it. And that's no different, ultimately, fromour collective decision that colorful rectangles of paper are valuableand that we'll accept goods and services in exchange for them."

By extension, according to this suggestions, money cannot be touched or smelled. Currency is the coin, note, orobject that is presented as the physical form of money.

Whatmatters most about money is not what it is, but what it does. After all,people will use the currencies that lubricate commerce, allow people toexchange goods and services, and thus encourage people to work andcreate. Money, whether it's represented by a metal coin, a shell or apiece of paper, doesn't always have value. Its value depends on theimportance that people place on it—as a store of value, a unit ofaccount, and a medium of exchange. Money is valuable merely becauseeveryone knows that it will be accepted as a form of payment. However,throughout history, both the usage and the form of money have evolved."
