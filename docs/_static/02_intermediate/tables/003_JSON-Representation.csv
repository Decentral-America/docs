Field, Description
"senderPublicKey", ":ref:`Public key <02_intermediate:Account Keys>` of the transaction sender: base58 encoded byte array."
"sender", ":ref:`Address <02_intermediate:Address>` of the transaction sender: base58 encoded byte array."
"feeAssetId", "ID of the fee token. null means that the fee is in :ref:`DecentralCoins <02_intermediate:DecentralCoin>`. The sender can specify the fee for :ref:`invoke script transactions <02_intermediate:Invoke Script Transaction>` and :ref:`transfer transactions <02_intermediate:Transfer Transaction>` in a sponsored asset, see the :ref:`sponsored fee <02_intermediate:Sponsored Fees>` article for details."
"proofs", "Array of :ref:`transaction proofs <02_intermediate:Transaction Proofs>`. Up to :math:`8` proofs, each proof up to :math:`64` bytes base58 encoded."
"fee", ":ref:`Transaction fee <02_intermediate:Transaction Fees>`: an integer value indicated in the minimum fraction (“cent”) of the fee asset. For example, if the fee is :math:`0.001` DecentralCoins, :math:`100000` is indicated in the JSON representation, so far as :math:`1` DecentralCoin = :math:`10^{8}` Decentralites."
"id", "Transaction ID. For the transaction ID calculation method, see the :ref:`cryptographic practical details <02_intermediate:Cryptographic Practical Details>` article."
"type", "Transaction type. Type IDs are listed in the :ref:`transaction type <02_intermediate:Transaction Types>` article."
"version", "Transaction version. Versions for each type of transaction are listed in :ref:`transaction binary format <02_intermediate:Transaction Binary Format>` descriptions."
"applicationStatus", "Status of transaction execution: 1) succeeded: transaction is successful. 2) script_execution_failed: the dApp script or the asset script failed. See the :ref:`transaction validation <02_intermediate:Transaction Validation>` article for details."
"timestamp", Transaction timestamp specified by the sender: Unix time in milliseconds. The transaction cannot be added to the blockchain if the timestamp value is more than :math:`2` hours behind or :math:`1.5` hours ahead of current block timestamp."
"height", "The sequence number of the block that contains the transaction."
