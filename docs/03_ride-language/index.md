- header: "Statically-Typed"
  content: "Variable types are explicitly declared and thus are determined at compile time."
- header: "Lazy evaluation"
  content: "Evaluation of expressions is delayed until their values are actually needed."
- header: "Functional Programs"
  content: "Programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions"
- header: "Expression-Based"
  content: "Every (or nearly every) construction is an expression and thus yields a value."
- header: "Compiled Language"
  content: "Converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute."
- header: "Non-Turing Complete"
  content: "Limitations by design help ensure execution is secure and straightforward."
