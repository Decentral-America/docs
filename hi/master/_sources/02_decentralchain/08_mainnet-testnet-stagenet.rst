Connecting Node to Blockchain Network
=====================================

You can launch your node in any blockchain network. Select the network in the node configuration file. 

* For more information about the configuration file, see the :ref:`node configuration <documentation:placeholder>` article. 
* For installing a node, see the :ref:`install DecentralChain node <documentation:placeholder>` article. 
* For starting your own blockchain network, see the :ref:`custom blockchain <documentation:placeholder>` article.

Chain ID
========

Chain ID is a symbol that is passed over a network during a handshake and allows nodes not to connect to the nodes of other networks. The chain ID is used while building account addresses, therefore, an address on one blockchain network cannot be used on another network. The chain ID is also indicated in transactions so it is impossible to move transactions between different blockchain networks.
