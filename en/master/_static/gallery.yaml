# Metadata to create our example gallery. This YAML file does two things:
#
# 1. Used by `generate_gallery_images.py` to take snapshots of each item and place an image in `gallery`.
# 2. Used by our Gallery Grid directive to create the grid on our `examples/gallery.md` page.
#
# title: The title of each gallery item
# website: The website that will be used to create a snapshot of this item.
#    An image will be placed in docs/_static/gallery/{sanitized_title}.png
# img-bottom: The location where img-bottoms will be placed for each entry by generate_gallery_img-bottoms.py
#    This should follow the form shown above and is roughly the same for all items.
